This project is forked from https://github.com/aimacode/aima-javascript. This repository contains visualizations for the book "Artificial Intelligence â€” A Modern Approach" by Russell And Norvig. The original fork had some errors in the Javascript, so I forked it just to fix those mistakes.

A majority of the visualizations from the chapters have never been filled in in the original fork. It seems as though the project was abandoned. Maybe in the future I will make visualizations of my own for each chapter that doesn't have one yet.

The fixed visualizations can be viewed at: http://hubersam.github.io/aima-javascript/
